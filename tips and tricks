Changing a commit message
--------------------------
1. Commit has not been pushed online
    If the commit only exists in your local repository and has not been pushed to GitHub, you can amend the commit message with the git commit --amend command.
    On the command line, navigate to the repository that contains the commit you want to amend.
    Type git commit --amend and press Enter.
    In your text editor, edit the commit message and save the commit.
  
2. Amending the message of the most recently pushed commit
    Follow the steps above to amend the commit message.
    Use the push --force command to force push over the old commit. Ex: git push --force [example-branch]
