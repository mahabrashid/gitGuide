gitGuide
========

Instructions of git, github setup, cheat sheet, and other useful info.
Initiated by:
	-> first creating the remote repo called gitGuide (on github), 
	-> then cloning it into local GitHub directory (~/Documents/GitHub) with command:
		$ git clone git@github.com:mahabrashid/gitGuide.git , hence the directory has the same name as the repository name.
	-> then creating other files, and making other changes.
